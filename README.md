Hello and welcome to my page! 
I received my Undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering, with experience in C++, Verilog, System Verilog and SVA. I'm interested in Data Science,
Real Time Software, and Big Data Management. 

My lifelong goal is to teach those who are interested in developing code to solve real world problems, big or small. 

I can be reached at ashaki.gumbs@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashakig/. 

Happy Coding!
